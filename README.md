# Title: "Wireshark Traffic Analysis Lab"

**Objective**: To capture and analyze different network traffic types (DNS, ICMP, and HTTP).

**Tools Used**: Wireshark

**Description:**
In this lab, I captured and analyzed network traffic including DNS queries, ICMP echo requests/replies (ping), and HTTP traffic. Filters were used to isolate specific packet types for detailed analysis. This helped me understand network protocols and packet flow.
